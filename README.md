# Music-Reconstruction With Genetic Algorithms
In this project, we reconstruct music from various components extracted from an input of MIDI files, using genetic algorithms to create better sounding samples.

# Motivation
As a group of engineers and musicians, we naturally wanted to explore the intersection of AI, mathematics, and music. Our goal is take existing songs and use genetic algorithms to manipulate and create new, euphonious songs from existing samples.
